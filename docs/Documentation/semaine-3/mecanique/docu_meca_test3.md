## 1. üéØ Context and Objective of the Test

**Test 3 ‚Äì Advanced Level**  
Evaluate the ability to design, model, and validate a complex mechanical part while respecting:  
- The provided geometry (2D drawings and 3D renders)  
- The target mass (calculated to two decimal places)  
- Proper handling of units and rounding

## 2. üìê Specifications and Deliverables

- **Units**: MMGS (millimeter, gram, second)  
- **Precision**: 2 decimal places  
- **Material**: Aluminum 1060 (œÅ = 2700 kg/m¬≥)  
- **Fillets**: 12 √ó R10  
- **Holes**: All through unless otherwise noted  

### Deliverables

1. **CAD file** of the modeled part (.SLDPRT or equivalent)

## 3. Process and Methodology

All dimensions and tolerances from the provided document were strictly followed. Each step includes space to insert your screenshots to illustrate progress.

---

### 1. Import Plans and Prepare the File  
- **Goal**: Load the 2D/3D views and set the origin.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. Open the base CAD template.  
  2. Insert sketches of the top, front, and section views.  
  3. Verify the MMGS units and origin placement.  

---

### 2. Sketch the Main Outline  
- **Goal**: Draw the trapezoidal shape and the primary cutouts.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. On the top plane, sketch the outer contour using the correct dimensions.  
  2. Add the centered square cavities.  
  3. Define a symmetry axis to facilitate mirrored features.  

---

### 3. Extrusion and Initial Cut  
- **Goal**: Establish the base thickness and define volumes to remove.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. Extrude the main sketch to the specified heights (lower and upper zones).  
  2. Apply a planar cut to separate the two thickness levels.  

---

### 4. Create Secondary Cutouts and Grooves  
- **Goal**: Form the central groove and side cutouts.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. On the top face, sketch the groove (5 mm wide, 2.5 mm deep).  
  2. Perform an extrude-cut to remove material.  
  3. Mirror the operation on the opposite side.  

---

### 5. Drilling and Filleting  
- **Goal**: Add all through-holes and round internal edges.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. Model each √ò10 mm hole at the specified locations.  
  2. Apply R10 fillets to the 12 internal edges.  

---

### 6. Angled Cut and Angular Features  
- **Goal**: Execute the 130¬∞ cut and transition features.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. Sketch the inclined cut line on the side view.  
  2. Perform an extrude-cut through the entire body.  
  3. Verify the angle and adjust as needed.  

---

### 7. Final Details and Quality Check  
- **Goal**: Validate the part and prepare the final export.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. Measure all critical dimensions with the measurement tool.  
  2. Visually compare with the provided 3D renders (color, feature placement).  
  3. Save and correctly name the final `.SLDPRT` file.

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è Tasks to Complete

For each dimension set, calculate the mass of the part (in grams):

- **Q3a.** A = 193 mm; B = 88 mm; W = B/2; X = A/4; Y = B + 5.5 mm; Z = B + 15 mm  
- **Q3b.** A = 205 mm; B = 100 mm; W = B/2; X = A/4; Y = B + 5.5 mm; Z = B + 15 mm  
- **Q3c.** A = 210 mm; B = 105 mm; W = B/2; X = A/4; Y = B + 5.5 mm; Z = B + 15 mm  

> **To provide**:  
> - Mass values (g) rounded to 2 decimals  
> - Screenshot of the volume/mass calculation in your CAD software
