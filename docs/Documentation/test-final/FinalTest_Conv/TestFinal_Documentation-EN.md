## 1. Context & Objectives
<a name="1-context--objectifs"></a>

**Final Test ‚Äì Control System for a Sorting Conveyor**  
This final test of the **TEKBOT Robotics Challenge 2025** is a multidisciplinary synthesis event. Our role, as the electronics team, is to design and build the "brain" and "nervous system" of an automated sorting conveyor.

The project consists of developing a complete electronic system capable of driving a conveyor to sort objects (30mm cubes) based on their color (Green, Yellow, Red, Blue) and providing the sorting data in real-time to a web API.

**Specific Objectives of the Electronics Team:**
- **Develop a robust electronic architecture** on a PCB (KiCad) driving the sensors (presence, color) and an actuator (motor).
- **Implement inter-microcontroller communication** (I¬≤C between an ATmega328P and an ESP32) to separate the real-time control logic from network connectivity.
- **Develop structured embedded firmwares** (state machine) to autonomously orchestrate the entire sorting process.
- **Provide a "turnkey" electronic solution**, tested and validated, ready to be interfaced with the conveyor's chassis and the web interface.

#### 1.1. General Architecture of the Electronic System
The electronic architecture of the conveyor system is designed to ensure the complete automation of the waste sorting process. It integrates presence detection, color identification, motor control, and wireless communication capabilities for real-time monitoring via a web interface.

The main functional blocks of our electronic system are:
- Power Supply: Converts the battery's energy into the stable voltages required by the various components.
- Microcontrollers: An Arduino Nano (ATmega328P) and ESP32 duo for logic processing, peripheral control, and network connectivity.
- Sensors: Laser modules for presence detection and a color sensor for identifying waste.
- Actuator: A motor driver controlling the conveyor's DC motor.
- Inter-Microcontroller Communication: A secure I2C link between the Arduino Nano and the ESP32.

#### 1.2. Components and Detailed Operation

##### 1.2.1. Main Processing Unit (Arduino Nano - ATmega328P)
The Arduino Nano, based on the ATmega328P microcontroller, is the logical core of the sorting system. It is responsible for acquiring data from the presence sensors (lasers/photoresistors) and the color sensor. It implements the control algorithm for the conveyor motor, triggering its movement based on waste detection and stopping it for identification. Furthermore, the Arduino Nano acts as the master on the I2C bus, initiating communication and transmitting sorting data (color, counters) to the ESP32.

The choice of the Arduino Nano is perfectly aligned with the project requirements, which specify the use of an ATmega328P microcontroller or an Arduino Nano board, thus avoiding any scoring penalties. Its compactness, ease of programming via the Arduino IDE, and the vast support from its community make it a robust and efficient platform for rapid embedded project development.

Key pins used on the Arduino Nano include digital pins for interfacing with the laser modules and the L298N motor driver, analog pins for photoresistor readings, and pins A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL) dedicated to I2C communication.

![Arduino Nano Component Image](elec/media/ArduinoNano.jpeg)

##### 1.2.2. Communication Module and Web Interface (ESP32 Dev Kit v1)
The ESP32 Dev Kit v1 module is specifically integrated to meet the requirement of a real-time web monitoring interface. Its main function is to handle wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi) and to host the web server that displays the quantities of sorted waste. The ESP32 communicates with the Arduino Nano as a slave on the I2C bus, receiving counting and color identification data to update them on the web interface.

The decision to use the ESP32 is driven by its integrated Wi-Fi module, which is essential for the system's network connectivity. Its processing power is more than sufficient to simultaneously handle the I2C protocol, the Wi-Fi network stack, and HTTP requests from the web server.

The main connections for the ESP32 include its power supply via VIN (5V), the use of its 3V3 pin to power the low-voltage side of the logic level shifter, and GPIO pins 21 (SDA) and 22 (SCL) for I2C communication.
![ESP32 Component Image](elec/media/ESP32.jpeg)

##### 1.2.3. Bidirectional Logic Level Shifter (BSS138 Module)
The logic level shifter module, based on the BSS138 MOSFET, is an essential component to ensure reliable and secure I2C communication between the Arduino Nano (5V) and the ESP32 (3.3V). Its function is to translate logic signals bidirectionally between these two distinct voltage domains.

On our PCB, this module is integrated using two 1x06 female header connectors, identified as J2 and J9. These footprints were specifically sized to accommodate a commercial BSS138 breakout module, providing a compact solution and simplifying physical integration on our custom board.
![BSS138 Module Image](elec/media/BSS138.jpeg)

**Operation and Justification for the Optimal Choice:**
The operating principle of this shifter is based on using MOSFETs to allow for transparent and bidirectional voltage conversion. It is powered by two separate voltage sources: 5V (from the Buck DC-DC converter) on the High Voltage (HV) side, and 3.3V (provided directly by the ESP32) on the Low Voltage (LV) side.

When a 3.3V signal is sent by the ESP32, the shifter raises it to 5V for the Arduino Nano. This ensures that the Nano perceives a clear high logic level (5V), providing a comfortable 2V safety margin above its detection threshold (approx. 3V). Conversely, when the Arduino Nano sends a 5V signal, the shifter lowers it to 3.3V for the ESP32, thereby protecting its native 3.3V GPIO pins. The module also includes its own pull-up resistors for the SDA and SCL lines, eliminating the need for external components. This solution is recognized as the most robust and reliable for I2C communication between systems with different logic voltages.

Key connections include powering the High Voltage (HV) side with 5V and the Low Voltage (LV) side with 3.3V from the ESP32. The HV1/HV2 data pins are connected to the Arduino Nano's SDA/SCL pins, and the LV1/LV2 pins are connected to the ESP32's SDA/SCL pins.

##### 1.2.4. Color Sensor (GY-33 Module)
The GY-33 color sensor module (TCS34725) identifies the color of the waste. It measures the light intensity for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) components and transmits them to the Arduino Nano via I2C. A prior calibration is necessary to ensure accuracy. The module is connected to the I2C pins (SDA/SCL) of the Arduino Nano and is powered by 5V.
![GY-33 Sensor Image](elec/media/GY33.jpeg)

##### 1.2.5. Presence Sensors (KY-008 Laser Modules and Photoresistors)
Two KY-008 Laser modules and photoresistors detect the waste. When an object breaks the beam, the photoresistor's resistance increases, creating a voltage change read by the Arduino Nano.
- **Start Laser (J4)**: Triggers the motor to start.
- **Detection Zone Laser (J3)**: Triggers the motor to stop for color analysis.
![KY-008 Laser Module Image](elec/media/KY008.jpeg)

##### 1.2.6. Conveyor Motor Control (L298N Driver)
The L298N module (H-bridge) drives the DC motor. It receives low-current logic signals from the Nano (ENA, IN1, IN2) and supplies the necessary power to the motor from an external power source, controlling its speed and direction.![L298N Driver Image](elec/media/L298N.jpeg)

##### 1.2.7. Power Supply Module (Buck DC-DC - U3)
The Buck DC-DC converter regulates the variable input voltage from the Lithium battery to a stable 5V, which is essential for the Arduino Nano, sensors, and the driver's logic side.

##### 1.2.8. Decoupling Capacitors (C1, C2, C3, C4)
Placed near key components, they filter noise and stabilize the power supply lines, ensuring system reliability.

##### 1.3.2. Version 2: Schematic with I2C and Simple Pull-up Resistors
- **Description**: Migrated to the I2C protocol. Attempted to manage the voltage difference (5V/3.3V) with simple 4.7kŒ© pull-up resistors connected to 3.3V.
- **Schematic**: ![V2 I2C Pull-up Schematic](elec/media/Schema-V2-I2C-Pullup.png)
- **Reason for Abandonment**: A technical analysis revealed a very low safety margin for the Arduino Nano (0.3V), making the system potentially vulnerable to electrical noise and compromising long-term reliability.

##### 1.3.3. Version 3 (Final): Schematic with I2C and a Dedicated Level Shifter
- **Description**: The final and most robust solution, using a dedicated logic level shifter (BSS138) for reliable inter-voltage I2C communication.
